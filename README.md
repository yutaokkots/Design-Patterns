# Design Patterns

## Introduction

> One thing expert designers know not to do is solve every problem from first principles. Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past. When they find a good solution, they use it again and again. Such experience is part of what makes them experts. Consequently, you'll find recurring patterns of classes and communicating objects in many object-oriented systems. These patterns solve specific design problems and make object-oriented designs more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable. They help designers reuse successful designs by basing new designs on prior experience. A designer who is familiar with such patterns can apply them immediately to design problems without having to rediscover them. [1]

>[Design patterns are] *descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular contex*.[2]

## Importance of Design Patterns

- Because design patterns encapsulate solutions to recurring problems, conceptualizing and understanding patterns allows for an **abstraction for reasoning about designs**. 
- The patterns integrate and encapsulate **best practices** that have been proven to work. 
- Patterns bridge the gap between high level design concepts with implementation allowing for easier **transition between design and development**. 
- Having a common **design vocabulary** allows common language for discussion among developers.
- Patterns enable **documentation** of explicit solutions to common problems.
